## Introduction
NeuroSimEnv is a simulation environment designed to explore and study the presence of place and grid cells in neural networks. Utilizing the powerful CoppeliaSim platform, this project aims to create a detailed and customizable simulation for neuroscientific experiments focused on spatial navigation and representation.

## Features
- **High-Fidelity Simulation**: Realistic physics and sensor simulations using CoppeliaSim.
- **Customizable Environments**: Easily create and modify environments for different experimental setups.
- **Python Integration**: Control the simulation and collect data using the Python remote API.
- **Pre-Built Models**: Access a library of pre-built robot models and sensors.
- **Data Logging**: Log simulation data for post-processing and analysis.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
